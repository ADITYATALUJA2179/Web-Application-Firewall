# Web_Application_Firewall

This project is a Web Application Firewall (WAF) designed to protect web applications from malicious requests. Web applications are becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other malicious attacks.
Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are critical components. They act as a protective barrier between web applications and potential attackers by filtering and monitoring HTTP requests               |                             |

## Overview

This project is a Python-based Web Application Firewall designed to detect and mitigate various web-based threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and brute-force attacks. This WAF uses a Logistic Regression model to classify incoming HTTP requests as either good or bad, enhancing the security of the web application it protects.


## Architecture

The architecture of the WAF is composed of the following components:

1. **Proxy Server**: Acts as an intermediary between the client and the web server.
2. **Request Logger**: Logs incoming requests for analysis and model training.
3. **Feature Extractor**: Extracts relevant features from HTTP requests for ML model input.
4. **Logistic Regression Model**: Trained model to classify requests as good or bad.
5. **Decision Engine**: Uses the model's prediction to allow or block the request.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Library**: Scikit-learn
- **Data Handling**: Pandas
- **HTTP Handling**: Requests
- **Logging**: Python's logging module
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled HTTP requests. Each request is classified as either good (legitimate) or bad (malicious). The dataset includes various features extracted from the HTTP headers, body, and other metadata.


## Installation

 **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
  git clone
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Proxy Server**:
   ```sh
   python proxy_server.py
   ```

2. **Monitor Logs**:
   Check the logs generated by the proxy server to see the classification of requests.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the Logistic Regression model consists of labeled HTTP requests. Each request is classified as either good (legitimate) or bad (malicious). The dataset includes various features extracted from the HTTP headers, body, and other metadata.


## Machine Learning Model

The Logistic Regression model is trained using the prepared dataset. The model learns to identify patterns and features that distinguish good requests from bad ones.
